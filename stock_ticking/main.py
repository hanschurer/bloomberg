# Implement the following two functions such that they are optimal. addStocksVolume receives a symbol (INTC, APPL, etc) plus a volume which you cumulate over time. topKstocks would return the k stocks with the highest volume.

# void addStocksVolume(string stockSymbol, int volume) {

# }

# vector<string> topKstocks(int k) {
# 	 return k top stocks 
# }
