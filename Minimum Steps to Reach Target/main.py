You start with the integer 1. At each step, you may perform exactly one of the following operations:
    n=n×2
    n=n÷3

Given a target integer tt, determine the minimum number of steps required to reach tt starting from 1.


# Example 1
Input: t = 2
Steps: 1 -> 2
Output: 1


# Example 2
Input: t = 10
One possible path: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 8 -> 16 -> 5 -> 10
Steps = 6
Output: 6

# Example 3
Input: t = 1
Already at target
Output: 0
