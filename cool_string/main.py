# Given a string,
# It can be cool string if
# 1. All Characters have same frequency
# 2. If we can remove only 1 character and make it a cool string

# Example:

# aaabbb -> true
# Explanation: Both a and b have same frequencies
# aaabbbcccc -> true
# Explanation: a and b occur 3 times but c occurs 4 times, we can remove 1 c to make this into a cool string
# aaabbbccccdddd -> false
# Explanation: a and b occur 3 times but c and d occur 4 times we'd have to remove 1 c and 1 d to make it cool string
# aabbcccdddeeee -> false
# Explanation: a and b occur 2 times, c and d occur 3 times, and e occurs 4 times. We'd have to remove 1 c and 2 e's to make it cool string
